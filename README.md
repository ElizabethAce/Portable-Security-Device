# Portable-Security-Device
A portable, personal security system designed to bring peace of mind whether you’re at home, in a hotel, or staying in an Airbnb. The device helps protect against unauthorized entry and alerts users in real time, making it easy to take safety with you wherever you go.
		
• 🔒 Portable Protection – lightweight, compact design for travel or home use.

• 🚪 Entry Detection – monitors doors or windows for unauthorized access.

• 📢 Alert System – triggers an audible or visible alarm when a breach is detected.

• 🔋 Low-Power Operation – designed for extended use on battery power.

• ⚡ Easy Setup – quick to setup in any environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
  •	Microcontroller: [e.g., Arduino, ESP32]
  
  •	Sensors: [e.g., reed switch]
  
  •	Additional Components: [LEDs, buzzer, etc.]
  
  • Other: Cellular App

## 🚀 Getting Started
	1.	Clone the repository:
  2.	Open the project in an IDE or toolchain (e.g., PlatformIO in VSCode, Arduino IDE).
	3.	Build and flash the firmware to your microcontroller.
	4.	Connect the hardware components as described in the schematic.

## 📖 Project Motivation
This project was inspired by real-life experiences of theft in hotels and short-term rentals. The goal is to create a portable, reliable, and affordable security option that travelers can easily carry and use, adding an extra layer of peace of mind.


## 🧩 Future Improvements
	•	Mobile app integration for alerts.
	•	Wireless connectivity (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).
	•	Compact custom PCB design.
	•	Rechargeable power system.
